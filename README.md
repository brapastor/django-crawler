Integration of Django with a python web-crawler.
The "CrawlerLogic" file was not written by me.
I used it with the permission of the owner.

Site that uses crawling to generate graph of a site.
Few examples:

```

The graphs are generated with cytoscape.js.
Url field is with validation.
There are two options to crawl: shallow and deep.
Depending on which one you choose, different number of
pages will show on the graph.
